# modern-python-datascience-cookiecutter

This [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) project is a make-friendly, Github Actions CI/CD [batteries included](.github/workflows/python-app.yml) starter Python project that combines [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/). It is partially inspired by Claudio Jolowicz's [Hypermodern Python](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) article series. 

At present, it includes numpy and pandas for data science packages. In the future, it will include jupyterlab.

Run:

```shell
 cookiecutter https://github.com/lhayhurst/modern-python-datascience-cookiecutter.git
 ```
 
 To use it.
